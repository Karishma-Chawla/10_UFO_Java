# Overview
This project was to present a table from UFO Sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. The table was to be filtered based by multiple criteria thereby creating a dynamic website. JavaScript was used to build the table and HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to improve the aesthetics of the website.
#Results
By typing in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters, the result returns 2 matches. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

# Summary 
## Draw backs
The user must know input variable like specific dates, exact city name, or shapes to search. Also, the search is case sensitive so that might result in exclusion of data tables if the user does not search the exact lower case spellings.

## Recommendation
1.	The next addition to the filters should allow for upper and lower cases to include all possible outcomes.
2.	Instead of specific date, there should also be an option to filter on the basis of a range of date that might help in the study of UFO Sightings
